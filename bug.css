The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

.specialClass {
  color: red !important;
}

p {
  color: green;
}

.specialClass p {
  color: purple;
}

<div class="specialClass">
  <p>This text should be purple.</p>
</div>
```

The unexpected behavior is that despite the `!important` declaration on `.specialClass`, the paragraph (`<p>`) inside still inherits the `color: green` from its parent, and is not purple as expected. The problem lies in the fact that the `!important` declaration only overrides the specificity conflict on the direct element, which is the `div`.  The inheritance chain for the paragraph element's color property is not affected by `!important` on its parent.
